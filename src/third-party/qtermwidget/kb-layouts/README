[README.KeyTab]

The keytabs offered in the Options/Keyboard menu are
taken from from configurations files with a *.keytab
pattern either located in $KDEDIR/share/apps/konsole
or ~/.kde/share/apps/konsole.

Keytabs allow to configure the behavior of konsole
on keyboard events, especially for functions keys.
Please have a look into the README.keyboard file, too.

The syntax is that each entry has the form : 

  "key" Keyname { ("+"|"-") Modename } ":" (String|Operation)

Keynames are those defined in <qnamespace.h> with the
"Qt::Key_" prefix removed.

Mode names are: 

  - Shift   : Shift Key pressed
  - Alt     : Alt Key pressed
  - Control : Control Key pressed

  ( The VT100 emulation has modes that can affect the
    sequences emitted by certain keys. These modes are
    under control of the client program.
  
    - Newline     : effects Return and Enter key.
    - Application : effects Up and Down key.
    - Ansi        : effects Up and Down key (This is for VT52, really).

    Since sending a state to a program that has set the state
    itself is positivly wrong and obsolete design, better forget
    about this nasty detail. I may well remove this "feature"
    in a future clean up round. )

  A "+" preceeding a Modename means the Key is pressed.
  A "-" preceeding a Modename means the Key is not pressed.
  If no mode is given it means don't care.

  Note that the combination of Key and Modes (set/reset)
  has to be unique. This means, that

    key A + Shift : "A"
    key A : "a"

  will not accept the small letter "a" rule as expected,
  one has to add a "- Shift" to the last clause. Use
  the stdout/stderr dianostics of konsole when modifying
  keytabs to find problems like this.

Operations are

  - scrollUpLine   : scroll up   one line in the history log
  - scrollUpPage   : scroll up   one page in the history log
  - scrollDownLine : scroll down one line in the history log
  - scrollDownPage : scroll down one page in the history log
  - emitClipboard  : "paste" the current clipboard
  - emitSelection  : "paste" the current selection

Strings have the syntax of C strings,
one may use the following escapes:

  - \E - escape
  - \\ - backslash
  - \" - double quote
  - \t - tab
  - \r - return
  - \n - newline
  - \b - backspace
  - \xHH - where HH are two hex digits
